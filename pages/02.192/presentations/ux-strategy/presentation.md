# _What is the difference between tactics and strategy?_

---



# Tactics vs. Strategy

Tactic

* Shorter term
* To meet a specific product/project need
* Sub-set of available resources
* The ‘How’, in the form of a plan

---



# Tactics vs. Strategy

Strategy

* Longer term
* To meet broad organizational needs
* Full set of available resources
* The ‘What’, in the form of a system

# Problem Statement

A brief description of the issue that needs to be solved by a project or group

---

# Sample Problem Statement Format, by Jeff Gothelf

**[Our service/product]** was designed to achieve **[goals]**. We have observed that the service/product isn’t meeting **[these goals]**, which is causing **[this adverse effect]** to our business. How might we improve **[service/product]** so that our customers are more successful based on [these measurable criteria]?

---

# Preferred Problem Statement Format (source unknown)

**[Stakeholder]** needs a way to **[need]** because **[insight]**.

_Grav Open Course Hub Project Examples_

Example #1: *Educators* need a means to *use and provide educational materials outside their LMS to reach their pedagogical goals* while *still keeping sensitive student data within their LMS*.

Example #2: *Students* need a way to *more quickly and easily access all required educational materials* so *their time online is not wasted by needing to navigate between multiple websites*.

* Has one objective    
* Provides creative latitude  
* Manageable in scope

# Methods Helpful in Defining Problem Statements

- Observation  
- Exploring PoV (Points of View)  
- Asking Why?

# A Caveat about Asking “Why”

Asking someone “Why” they do something can make them feel defensive, so sometimes alternative phrasing is better such as asking something like “What was your intention in doing that?”

# Activity: Problem Statement

GROUPS OF 2-3

A good problem statement is:  

✓ Human-centered  
✓ Has one objective

# Imagining Future State

* User Stories
* Product Design Principles

---

# Harnessing User Stories

---

# What is a User Story?

At its core, a user story is a _collaborative design tool_ that helps teams better view their product from the perspective of those who will actually use it.

---

# (Agile) User Story Structure

As a **role**,  
I want to **goal/desire**  
so that **benefit**

---

# User Stories for Agile

When used within an Agile approach, story size is often dictated by sprint length

---

# Example Agile User Stories
As a _Central Canadian Bank customer_,  
I want to _register for an online account_  
so that _I can pay my bills online._

As a _Central Canadian Bank customer_,  
I want to _log into my online account_  
so that _I can pay my bills online._

As a _Central Canadian Bank customer_,  
I want to _manage the details of my account_  
so that _I can pay my bills online._

---



# User Stories for Requirements

* Includes reaching the user’s goal
* User plays a central role
* No interface assumptions are stated
* Can be linked to usage importance and frequency
* Can be initially fairly broad in nature (esp. for strategic usage)

---

# Example High-level User Stories
As a _Central Canadian Bank customer_,  
I want to _withdrawal funds from an ATM_  
so that _I have the cash I need on hand._

As a _Central Canadian Bank customer_,  
I want to _transfer funds from one account to another_  
so that _I have the funds to cover a large cheque_.

---
<!--
# Example Grav Open Course Hub High-level User Stories

As a _student_,  
I want to _easily contact the instructor with questions_  
so that _I can be sure to understand the materials correctly_.

As an _instructor_,  
I want to _have students suggest course material improvements_  
so that _everyone can benefit from each other’s experiences and knowledge_.

GROUPS OF 2-3

As a **role**,  
I want to **goal/desire**

✓ Includes reaching the user’s goal  
✓ User plays a central role  
✓ No interface assumptions are stated  
✓ Can be linked to usage importance and frequency  
✓ Can be initially fairly broad in nature (esp. for strategic usage)

# Product Design Principles

Unlike generic design principles (i.e. ‘easy to use’), product design principles are a set of design principles specific to a particular product or service

---



# Windows UX Design Principles

* Reduce concepts to increase confidence
* Small things matter, good and bad
* Be great at “look” and “do”
* Solve distractions, not discoverability
* UX before knobs and questions
* Personalization, not customization
* Value the life cycle of the experience
* Time matters, so build for people on the go

---



# HTC Sense’s Design Principles:

* Make it Mine: personalization needs to reach a level never before possible.
* Stay Close: staying in touch with the people in your life means managing a variety of communication channels and applications.
* Discover the Unexpected: many of the most memorable moments in your life are experienced, not explained

---
<!--


# Grav Open Course Hub Design Principles (Students):

# Grav Open Course Hub Design Principles (Faculty):

* Controllable
* Pliable

[.build-lists: true]

# Defining Product Design Principles

* Based on user research/knowledge
* More specific, less generic
* Easily memorized/internalized
* Encompassing broad aspects of the product
* Shared/distributed far beyond UX team

# (Suggested) Process

1. Conduct background research
1. Identify user group and map audience/purpose
1. Consider appropriate level of granularity
1. Decide what you need to learn
1. Write down your existing assumptions
1. Talk (and observe if possible) with users
1. Start with touchpoints and actions, and organize as timeline
1. Group touchpoints and actions as phases, and then align user goals/needs
1. Further build-out as text map first, then visualize if appropriate

# Interview Tips

* Explain the purpose of the interview up-front
* Minimize yes/no type questions
* Focus on learning about their circumstances, motivations, experiences and feelings
* Get comfortable with silence
* Ask them to share stories and examples
* Watch out for described workarounds, difficulties, etc.
* Paraphrase to show you are listening and to confirm facts
