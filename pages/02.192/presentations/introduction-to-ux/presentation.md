# Contemporary HCI Issues (Yvonne Rogers)

- Turn to design (user experience, enjoyment, play and pleasure)
- Turn to culture (human conditions and nature)
- Turn to the wild (augmenting people, places and settings)
- Turn to embodiment (practical engagement with social and physical environment)

### Design Thinking

---

# What is Design Thinking?

- Not a type of thinking, but more of a mindset
- Process plays a role, similar user-centered design
- Anthropology and Sociology also play a role

---

# Design Thinking

> “Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer’s toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the
possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.”
– Tim Brown (President and CEO of IDEO)

# Five Whys

A technique to help reveal cause and effect, through asking “Why?” often in five iterations (part of the “[Toyota Way](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The*Toyota*Way)”)

# What is Usability?

![fit](images/tumblr-signup.jpg)

---

# Usability Means...

---

# Usability Means...

Usability means that a person using a system finds it easy to understand and use

---

# Usability Means...

A usable system allows a person to focus on their tasks, and not on the system itself

---

# Usability Means...

A usable system most often does what a person expects

---

![fit](http://assets.uxbooth.com/uploads/2016/06/Guidance-on-Usability.png)

---

# What is Usability?

More specifically, usability can be defined as:

- A measurement
- A design approach

---

# Usability as a Measurement (as defined by Jakob Nielsen)

- Learnability
- Efficiency
- Memorability
- Error Rate
- Satisfaction

---

# Learnability

Learnability – how easy is it for novice users to work with the system?

---

# Efficiency

Efficiency – how efficient is it for experienced users to work with the system?

---

# Memorability

Memorability – how easy is it for less frequent users to remember how to use the system?

---

# Error Rate

Error Rate – how many errors (on average) do users make when working with the system?

---

# Satisfaction

Satisfaction – how pleasant do users find the system to work with?

---

[.background-color: #2d6e92]

# Activity: Usability Elements

How would we consider trade-offs, such as Learnability vs Efficiency?
