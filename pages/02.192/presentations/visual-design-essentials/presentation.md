# Visual Design Essentials

### CMPT 363

> “To design is much more than simply to assemble, to order, or even to edit; it is to add value and meaning, to illuminate, to simplify, to clarify, to modify, to dignify, to dramatize, to persuade, and perhaps even to amuse.”  
– Paul Rand

# What About Fonts?

A font is a specific rendering (i.e. size, weight, style, etc.) of a typeface.  This is the same relationship as a song to a mp3 file.

# Selecting Typefaces

* Context (i.e. environment)
* Legibility (i.e. for individual characters)
* Readability (i.e. for blocks of text)

---

# Tips about Selecting Typefaces

* Stick with classic combinations (check out [fontsinuse.com](http://fontsinuse.com))
* Limited palette (i.e. often only 2 different typefaces)
* Consider your planned visual hierarchy

# Typeface Anatomy

# Type Measurement

72 points = 1 inch   
6 picas = 1 inch    
12 points = 1 pica

# Activity: Typography Analysis

Analyze the use of typography of (the responsively designed) [microsoft.com](http://microsoft.com).   

Consider the factors of typeface selections with regards to **context** (i.e. environment), **legibility** (i.e. for individual characters), and **readability** (i.e. for blocks of text).  

Also be on the lookout for **kerning** (space between pairs of characters), **tracking** (spacing of multiple characters), and **leading** (spacing between lines).

# Visual Design Essentials
### Grouping, Grids, and Visual Hierarchy

---

# Grouping

Grouping similar or related elements on the screen can help viewers locate information most important to them.

---

# Principles of Grouping (Gestalt Laws)

The Gestalt laws of grouping are a set of principles in cognitive psychology, which attempt to account describe how people tend to organize visual elements into groups.

# Grids

By segmenting a screen using invisible grid lines you can more easily both organize and present content. While sometimes subtle, the use of grids can also help content appear more refined in nature.

# Visual Hierarchy

Visual hierarchy is the organization and prioritization of content in order to improve the communication of that content

---



# Aspects of Visual Hierarchy

* Size
* Color
* Alignment
* Whitespace

### Visual Design Principles

---



# Visual Design Principles

* Alignment
* Proximity
* Repetition
* Contrast

---

# Alignment

Alignment refers to items on a page being lined up with each other

---

# Effective Alignment

Primarily use only one type of alignment (e.g. left, right, centered)  on a single page

---

[.background-color: #FFFFFF]

![fit](images/apple-2016-01.png)

---

[.background-color: #FFFFFF]

![fit](images/apple-2016-02.png)

---

# Effective Alignment

While centered alignment easily provides visual balance, it is also less visually strong and can make multiple lines of text harder to read than other forms of alignment

---

---

[.background-color: #FFFFFF]

![fit](images/microsoft-2016-3.png)

---

# Effective Alignment

Align horizontal elements, avoiding up/down/up/down situations, along an invisible baseline

---

[.background-color: #FFFFFF]

![fit](images/microsoft-2016-4.png)

---

# Proximity

Proximity refers to the relationships that can be communicated between items on a page, based on how close they are to each other

---

# Effective Proximity

Place objects that have strong relationships with each other close to each other

---

[.background-color: #FFFFFF]

![fit](images/apple-2016-04.png)

---

# Effective Proximity

Perform a ‘squint test’ to help gauge proximity effectiveness by closing one eye, and then squinting the other eye until the page is out of focus

Be careful of too many visual groups, or equal spacing everywhere with the result of no visual focal point

# Time for More Questions & Discussion

* What we’ve covered so far
 * Alignment
 * Proximity      
* Coming up
 * Repetition

---

# Repetition

Repetition refers to the repeated use of particular design elements on a page, and also between pages

---

# Effective Repetition

Reuse visual design elements (e.g. color, font, graphics, layout, etc.) to help communicate a sense of design unity

---

---

[.background-color: #FFFFFF]

![fit](images/microsoft-2016-6.png)

---

# Contrast

Contrast refers to how much visual difference there is between various items on a page

---

# Effective Contrast

Use contrast to provide a visual hierarchy, and help guide the viewer’s eye around a page

---

[.background-color: #FFFFFF]

![fit](images/apple-2016-11.png)

---

[.background-color: #FFFFFF]

![fit](images/microsoft-2016-7.png)

---

# Effective Contrast

If two items (fonts, graphics, etc.) are different then make them clearly visually distinct, otherwise make them identical

---

[.background-color: #FFFFFF]

![fit](images/apple-2016-12.png)

---

# Effective Contrast

Use contrast to bring focus to the most important elements of a page. Again, a ‘squint test’ can help gauge contrast effectiveness

---

# Visual Design Principles

* Check alignment
* Group similar items together
* Create repetitive elements
* Use contrast appropriately (esp. visual hierarchy)
