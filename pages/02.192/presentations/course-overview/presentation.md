# Course Overview

### CMPT 363

> When software is hard to use, don’t make excuses for it. Improve it. When a user makes a mistake, don’t blame the user. Ask how the software misled them. Then fix it. The user’s time is more valuable than ours. Respect it. Good UI design is humble.
-- Jono DiCarlo

# [fa=fa-exclamation-triangle] Reasons To Avoid This Course [fa=fa-exclamation-triangle]

* Weekly readings, along with a quiz, are required
* Frequent in-class individual and group exercises
* Group assignment(s) are mandatory
* Assignments will require a substantial amount of effort
* Satisfactory peer reviews will be a requirement to receive grades for certain assignments
* Good communication _and_ writing skills are critical  
* It is a design course, where assessments will often be determined on subjective opinion (primarily mine)
* I expect your designs to be more than just usable (also useful and desirable)
* Instructor design review and critique session
* Getting A’s in other computer science courses has little relevance in this course

---



# Reasons Why You Might Want To Stick Around

* A ~~good~~ great UX is now a software industry expectation
* Poorly designed interfaces cost money, require additional support, and waste people’s valuable time
* A basic understanding of user experience design processes and techniques will be helpful when working in the software industry
* You will experience how to work on design challenges
within teams
* The user-centered design process and techniques that you will learn can be applied to many other domains
* You have the opportunity to learn from an experienced industry practitioner and educator ([ca.linkedin.com/in/paulhibbitts/](http://ca.linkedin.com/in/paulhibbitts/))

# Laptop Policy - Let’s Discuss!

As both an instructor and audience member, I have found the increasing use of laptops to be a major distraction, not only for the people actually using laptops but also for those sitting around them

# One Minute Wrap-up Summary (A.K.A. Bonus Points Opportunity)

Immediately after (up until 12 midnight the day of class) you will be asked to write down and answer via the  [Canvas Class Discussion Board](https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/38847/discussion_topics) the most valuable thing you learned, and any questions that you may still have.
