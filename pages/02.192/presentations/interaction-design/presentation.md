---

# 1D: Words

Includes all text visible to the user.    

---

# 2D: Visual representations

Includes typography, imagery, icons, color palette, etc.

---

# 3D: Physical objects or space

Includes computer keyboards, mice, trackpads, and touchscreens that users interact with and the space they interact within.

---

# 4D: Time

Includes all interactive elements that change over time, such as motions, sounds, and animations.

---

# 5D: Behaviour

Includes how users react to an interaction - physically and emotionally.

# Interaction Design

### HCI Laws

---

# HCI Laws

* Miller's Law
* Hick's Law
* Power Law of Practice
* Fitts' Law

---

# Miller's Law

In 1956, George Miller published the paper "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information"

---

# Miller's Law

More recent research (Baddeley, 1986) indicates the capacity is closer to 3-4 items

---

# Miller's Law

The ability of working memory to store short-term information can be increased by "chunking" data

---

---

# Hick's Law

Hick's law estimates the time it takes for a person to make a choice as a result of the number of possible choices presented

---

# Hick's Law

T = b log2(n + 1)

b = empirically determined constant
n = number of choices

---

---

# Power Law of Practice

Mathematically expresses that performing the same physical action over a period of time tends to increase performance

---

# Power Law of Practice

Time n = Time 1* n-.4

Time 1 is first time to perform task, n is number of trails
Time n is time to perform task after n times

---

---

# Fitts' Law

Fitt’s law (1954) is a model of human movement

---

# Fitt's Law

T = k log2(D/S + 0.5), k ~ 100 msec.

T = Time to move the hand to target
D = distance between hand and target
S = size of target
