##### Course Description
In this course we will explore the art and science of designing usable, useful and enjoyable human-computer interfaces, with an emphasis on user-centered design techniques. The importance and necessity of effective interaction design techniques will be highlighted, and current design methodologies and principles across multiple platforms will be discussed. Students will gain valuable knowledge and experience by working in groups on a term-long design project.
